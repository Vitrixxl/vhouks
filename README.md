# Here is my react hook component

## first question, why ? 

Pretty simple i didn't want to relly on other libs and get a better understanding on what do i use. It will also help me with not rewrite or copy paste the same hooks over and over accross multiple projects

## Seconde question, wtf is wrong with the name ? 

vhooks couldn't fit with npm because there's a package named v-hooks and npm didn't like it, plus i'm french and the french for "ou" has the same sound as "oo" in english soooo.

# I use vim btw on arch
